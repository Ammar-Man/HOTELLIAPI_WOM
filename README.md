# HOTELLIAPI_WOM
 
Hotel app is an app that works with NoSQL with Mongo database to save the customer's information and token to remember with their login information in local storage so you can log in to the page with the token. at the same time, the server is running on the azure website. So several different servers contact each other to allow the customer to book a hotel room with the address and services needed for their room with the time and date

I manage to solve all tasks according to project 2 and project 1 and everything works perfectly!
